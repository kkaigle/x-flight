  <p><b>1.1 Code Of Conduct</b><br>
     All BlueStar pilots and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is respectful and constructive. Our discord is a very diverse place, and 
      respect for all is paramount in our airline. Content that is divisive, hateful, derogotory or illegal will be dealt with promptly by a staff member. This will be
      grounds for possible immediate dismissal from the airline without rehire rights.<br><br>
      <b>1.2 General Requirements</b><br>
      Pilots must own a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, X-Plane 11, FSX or Prepar3d V3+. <br>
      Must be a member in the discord and participation in the discord community beneficial to membership retention.<br><br>
      <b>1.3 Community Guidelines</b><br>
      The discord is a place for simulator pilots and community members to chat, share experience and help users. We do not tolerate any sort of disrespect or hate regardless
    who it is directed towards. Directors are not always present, and cannot monitor every chat constantly. Any instances that violate these rules please direct message LordRupert
    or Alex immediately.</p>

    <p><b>2.1 General Fly The World Information</b><br>
     Pilots wishing to fly using FTW need to register and download client software at https://www.ftw-sim.de. All accounts will be provisioned roughly daily.<br><br>
        <b>2.2 Pilot Qualifications</b><br>
        Pilots in FTW earn licenses by flight time. In a VA, those restrictions are eased and you are able to fly any aircraft available from the airline. The airline can dispatch
        a job for any pilot holding the required license, plus one level of qualification (Pilot holds PPL, may be dispatched up to CPL flight). For pilots that do not hold
        the license one above, the airline will post the job to the outsourcing market for a lower than average value to ensure the pilot has a fair attempt at getting the job. 
        Job licenses in FTW are as follows:<br><br>
        <b>Private Pilots License: 0-100hrs<br>  Commercial Pilots License: 100-250hrs<br>  Multi-Crew Pilots License: 250-750hrs<br>   Airline Transport Pilots License: 750+ hours</b><br><br>
    <b>2.3 Currency</b><br>
    BlueStar does not mandate any minimum flight hours in the VA, however we do keep track of inactivity within the community and on flight logs. We fully support a real life first
    mentality, but we hope that is discussed with directors prior to an extended absense. In order to better keep track of membership and activity, pilots that have not been active 
    within 30 days will be marked as "currency lapsed" in the community discord. After 60 days of no response or activity, pilots will move to the inactive roster and potentially
    removed from the airline. Pilots are always welcome back, as long as they did not violate TOS or community standards. Pilots will be reinstated otherwise upon contact with a 
    manager. <br><br>
        <b>2.4 Dispatching</b><br>
    Pilots can request a dispatch in discord, using the #dispatching-ftw channel. Requests for flights beyong 12 hours in advance will typically not be fulfilled immediately
    unless circumstances warrant (unavailable managers at desired time, ect...). Please notify which airframe, ICAO-ICAO in your request for a dispatcher to rapidly fulfill the
        request.<br><br></p>
