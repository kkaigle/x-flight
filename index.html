      <div><b>Welcome</b><br>
Welcome to BlueStar airlines. We operate our airline in North America and Europe. Join our discord if you are interested in discussing more about our fleet, and how we operate in the persistent multiplayer airline manager "Fly The World".
          <br><br><br>
          <b>New Interface</b><br>
          BlueStar has recently opted to offer 2 options of flight for our pilots. The airline has most recently adopted the persistent economic manager called Fly The World- a completely free VA manager, with a virtual economy comprised of thousands of airlines and pilots. The wonderful team at Aiena e.V. power the platform and work hard for our enjoyment. Some legacy pilots remain on the payware, subscription based platform but have the option to migrate to the new platform. Our goal is to create a completely free, virtual airline while challenging ourselves in a persistent economic airline manager. <br><br><br>

We can predetermine a route for you, or you can chose the route you fly that day. Our routes are optimized for our fleets and we continue to adjust our destinations based on seasons, travel variations and our pilots desires. We rotate our general aviation fleet throughout the world, so that pilots can enjoy all of the beautiful sceneries that our simulators have to offer. <br><br><br>
          
          <b>Aircraft Fleet</b><br>
          BlueStar has a diverse, large fleet. Whether you like to field hop in a Piper Arrow, Cessna 172, or Kodiak- Or you can hop in one of our airliners that range from the Bombardier CRJ700 to the Boeing 767-300ER. BlueStar is expanding our fleet as we hire new talent, so your input and desires are listened to when shaping our fleet and route network. Head over to our hangar to check out the fleet.
